I'm a Vietnamese who is bilingual and sucks at my own native language, I prefer English.
Calculus reduces stress for me, it's my safe place
Math is beautiful and logical :)
I'm an introvert, so if you see me not responding to what you say, I'm probably thinking about some random stuff, or doing integrals in my head, sorry if it bothers you
I'm usually not the type of person who flexes their achievements, I'm usually the one who is secretly up to something
Turns out I didn't know what a continued fraction was in vietnamese, Also other people sometimes say vietnamese phrases that I don't understand, even when its not related math, so when I ask them and they say the meaning in english, I instantly understand
I get bullied a lot in schools, but I don't care and usually focus on the positive side, where I have a lot of friends online
This txt document makes me comfortable describing myself because I feel no pressure to rush

My logo was inspired by when I tried making an origami icosahedron blindly with no tutorials, but failed and got missing sides, which it looked EXACTLY like this (logo.png), I even made sure it matched the exact chirality
